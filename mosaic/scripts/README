1) you'll need a file with name, RA, Dec, D_25 (or whatever radius of interest)

2) then, run 'get_driver.pro'

3) upload the resulting foot.list file to http://das.sdss.org/www/html/post_coords.html and use this page to generate a wget list for the corrected frames (ugriz) and tsField files.  optionally also get the drField files

4) run wget.  you'll get lot's of duplicates, so maybe allow clobbering.  is hould probably include a step to filter the wget script.

5) run sort_fits.pro to distribute the frames and tsField files into directories (which will have names as in your file)

6) run mega_driver.pro (just the sdss part).  you should set the /skytweak switch if you want to get the sky to be good across the fields


!!!all these scripts need to be tweaked for output filenames, sizes, plate scale!!!!!
