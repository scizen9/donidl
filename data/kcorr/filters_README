Notes about where filter curves come from:

The USNO 40" standard star system curves are given
at http://home.fnal.gov/~dtucker/ugriz/Filters/response.html
and include airmass 1.3 with the SITe 1024^2 detector response.
These are appropriate for point sources.  These filters
are named usno_g, usno_r, etc.

The SDSS 2.5 imager filters are also at airmass 1.3, and
are the values for point sources.  They were taken from
http://www.sdss.org/dr4/instruments/imager/index.html#filters
They have been renormalized so that the peak transmission is 1

The U-maiz filter is the new U band constructed by
 J. Maiz-Apellaniz 2006, AJ 131, 1184 using STIS SEDs

The HST filters are taken from synphot.

The Stritzinger filters are from csp1.lco.cl/~mhamuy/SPECSTDS
 and are the shifted versions.  Note that the RI filters in this
 set have atmospheric lines added.

The [BVRI]-shift filters are the Bessell filter functions shifted
 by the amounts calculated using the Stritzinger 05 SED library
 (synthetic_shift_landolt.pro) and with telluric lines added
 for R and I.

The [BVRI]-shift filters are the Bessell filters shifted as they were
 in Astier et al. (2006).

For the CFHT filters, there are three sets of transmission curves
available.  One was measured by CFHT, one by REOSC/SAGEM, and
the final set by Tom Benedict.  None of them are in the
appropriate converging beam.  The first two can be downloaded
from the CFHT web page

http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/MegaCam_Filters_data_SAGEM.txt
the third is only available in email form as of yet.

The quantum efficiency of the CCDs was taken from
 http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/E2V_CCD42-90_QEmodel.txt

The optics transmission and mirror reflection are from
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/CFHT_Primary_Transmission.txt
and
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/CFHT_MegaPrime_Transmission.txt

The atmospheric extinction file MaunaKea.Extinction is of uncertain
 provenance.  Mark knows.  I should probably ask him.

The Telluric absorption file (spec.atm_abscor.txt) was compiled
 by Greg Aldering, and is from 30 Hamuy spectrophotometric standards.
