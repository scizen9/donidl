24 Apr 1998
  EQV2: Upgraded by adding a number of new options and help text.  RES
  EQV2_LOAD_HELP: Uses text_block to load help text into variables.  RES
17 Apr 1998
  TVBOX: Fixed to be backward compatible with IDL 4.  RES
16 Apr 1998
  PLOTP: Added /CLIP keyword to clip to plot window for /DATA.  RES
  SUNALTAZI: Modified to handle arrays of times.  RES
15 Apr 1998
  SUNJS: Converted several if statements to calls to where so arrays
    of times can be used.  RES
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just returned NUMBERS structure.  RES
  DT_TM_MAK: Added a returned structure with numeric values, NUMBERS.  RES
14 Apr 1998
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new format item, sam$ = seconds after midnight.  RES
10 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Added WINDOW keyword to allow use in a draw widget.
    Also added /NOCURSOR keyword to indicate that incoming coordinates
    are to be used as device coordinates instead of calling the CURSOR
    routine.  Use both WINDOW=win and /NOCURSOR for draw widgets.  RES
9 Apr 1998
  WHOCALLEDME: Generalized to look back farther then parent.  Added
    new keyword BACK=b.  Default is parent as before.  BACK=0 gives
    self, BACK=2 gives grandparent, BACK=3 gives great grandparent,
    and so on.  Going back too far gives null string results.  RES
8 Apr 1998
  MAGCRS: Fixed to show first mag window on /INIT.  Also cleaned up
    the help text some.  RES
7 Apr 1998
  IMGPOLREC: Upgraded to allow non-centered pixels.  The specified ranges
    in angle and radius used to apply to the centers of the first and last
    pixels in angle and radius.  Added new keywords, /A_EDGE and /R_EDGE, so
    the given ranges can apply to the pixel edges to get the full pixels
    instead of cutting the first and last in half as before.  If new
    keywords not used should give same results as before.  RES
1 Apr 1998
  WORDARRAY: Now allows the ignore characters to be given as a simple
    string of characters to drop before processing.  Also allows
    a string of delimiter characters to be given in the same way.  RES
  EQV2: Added /NO_BLOCK to xmanager call to free up command line.  RES
31 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added SNAP button to make a snapshot of the current equation
    and settings.  RES
30 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed an undefined variable problem.  RES
27 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Fixed a minor glitch that occured when entering a new equation
    file.  Also generalized to allow parametric equations.  This is
    done by specifying a trange instead of xrange, and giving
    x=fx(t) & y=fy(t) instead of just y=f(x).  Can now do circles
    very easily.  RES
20 Mar 1998
  DT_TM_FULL: Upgraded a bit to deal with dashes, slashes, and commas
    in date.  RES
18 Mar 1998
  TVBOX: Made 24 bit color compatible.  RES
  GETENV2: New more portable version of getenv.  You may set up files
    with values instead of using unix environmental variables.  Should
    work on any operating system.  On unix may use either files or
    environmental variables.  RES
10 Mar 1998
  RADON: Cleaned up a bit (fixed so fractional angle steps work) and
    removed the byte only restriction.  RES
9 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added an optional int as 5th item for a parameter line in the eqv
    file.  This forces that value to be an integer, the slider value is
    truncated to an integer using the IDL fix function.  This is useful for
    setting flags if the equation is a user defined function, or for easily
    dealing with harmonics and so on.  A possible use is where the function
    has multiple variations based on an integer flag.  An example could be a 
    circle function that returns either the top or bottom half og the circle
    depending on whether a flag value is even or odd.  RES
6 Mar 1998
  EQV2: Added x scaling which gets applied after the equation gets
    executed but before plotting.  If the same integer scale factor
    is applied to the equation to scale y then harmonics may be
    easily plotted.  RES
3 Mar 1998
  TEXT_BLOCK: New routine to make it easy to print blocks of text.
    It will print all commented lines following its call in a routine,
    until the next uncommented line is found.  Also returns the text.  RES
2 Mar 1998
  EQV2: New routine to allow interactive function plotting on current window.
    Function parameters may be varied using widget sliders.  RES
24 Feb 1998

    Makes range array differences much more convenient.  RES
12 Feb 1998
  IMGUNDER: Made a conversion factor double.  RES
6 Feb 1998
  JSPLOT: Set defaults for the new keywords added yesterday.  RES
5 Feb 1998
  XVIEW: Fixed the save image problem in IDL 5.  RES
  BOX2B: Attempt to fix problem with last box erase on entry.  Better
    but still has some problems.  Also sometimes get a box of size 0.  RES
  JSPLOT: Fixed XTHICK, YTHICK, CHARTHICK to work correctly.  RES
  POINTS: Added new keyword /NORMALIZED to convert size in points
    to a size in normalized coordinates.  Returns a 2 element array
    since for non-square windows the size will be different in x and y.
    Intended to allow positioning using points.  RES
4 Feb 1998
  LINT: New routine to find the intersection of two lines in the XY plane.
    The two lines are each defined by giving two points on the line.  RES
3 Feb 1998
  DMS2D: New function to convert a string with degrees, minutes, and
    seconds to degrees as a double.  Inverse of d2dms.  Only works
    for scalar values.  May leave out sec or min and sec.  RES
23 Jan 1998
  CHECK5: New routine to check if running IDL version 5 or later.  RES
  CBAR: Added CHARTHICK keyword so that now works right.  RES
  SETCOLOR: Added new keyword BRIGHTNESS=fact to allow easy change in
    brightness of color.  Works with decimal or hex colors.  RES
19 Jan 1998
  SUNALTAZI: Renamed from sunpos to avoid a conflict with a routine of
    the same name in the IDLASTRO IDL library from GSFC.  The name is
    now better than it was but may be slightly confusing since the results
    are returned in the order azi, alt but the name has altazi.  Just
    be careful.  The conflict was pointed out by James Theiler of LANL.  RES
  SUN_ZD: Renamed a routine called internally from sunpos to sunaltazi.  RES
16 Jan 1998
  FILENAME: Changed to use !version.os_family instead of
    !version.os.  Was not working for Windows because !version.os
    was win32.  RES
15 Jan 1998
  MORE: Modified to be more portable.  It was using filepath(/terminal)
    which worked ok on unix but is not portable.  It now works pretty
    well for unix and not so well for Windows.  Can't seem to print a
    backspace in Windows.  RES
  COLOR: Modified to return as text color the darkest or brightest
    value, depending on what gives best contrast.  RES
14 Jan 1998
  Following routines modified to drop the use of !d.n_colors:
    chinit, color, color_quanj, colorwarn, crossi, crossi2, ctool, eqv,
    fill_cont, hline, hori, imgline, imgscale, jsplot, ls, makevlt,
    paint, pickcolor, pltcrv, rotvlt, shade_surf2, slowplot, sprint,
    sun_colors, testcolor, topc, veri, vimgseq, ,vline webshadow,
    xced1, xmerge, xtextimg, xview.  RES
9 Jan 1998
  IMGSQZ: New routine to squeeze out colors not used greatly to make
    room for custom colors.  Moves image and color table values around
    to put the freed colors at the bottom of the color table.  RES
8 Jan 1998
  SET_SCALE: Fixed a bug where of one of the requested floating values
    (x1,x2,y1,y2) was an int it was returned as an int.  Now forces floats. RES
31 Dec 1997
  JS2WEEKDAY: New routine to return week day given Julian Second.
    May return number or name.  RES
  JD2JS: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  JS2JD: Emphasized the fact that JD starts at noon.  RES
  DATE2JD: Minor help text fix.  RES
30 Dec 1997
  SUN_COLORS: Converted color table file to a text file to be more
    portable.  RES
  COLOR: Dropped the use of getenv to find the colors file.  Now uses
    whoami to look in the source directory for colors.txt.  Also converted
    colors file to a simple text file for easier use.  Should rewrite
    someday.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_FROMJS: Just passed new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec on to dt_tm_mak.  RES
18 Dec 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Added new keyword DDECIMAL=ddec to set number of decimal
    places in day of year (if given in format).  Def=none.  RES

  TVBOX: Modified to keep box size GE 1.  RES
3 Nov 1997
  IMGNEG: Simple image processing routine that converts a color image
    to its negative.  Used as an example for the new custom PROCESS
    pull-down in XVIEW.  RES
  XHOTLIST: Added browse option to this routine.  Should now allow
    system independent directory browsing.  RES
  XVIEW: Three upgrades: (1) Added browse option to directory hotlist,
    (2) Added user defined PRINT and PROCESS pull-down menus,
    (3) Added help to the HELP button.  RES
13 Oct 1997
  WEB_BACK: A primitive but effective routine to generate a background
    image for tiling a web page.  RES
25 Sep 1997
  FILEBREAK: Fixed to work for Windows IDL.  Still no support for the Mac
    since I don't have access to one.  RES
24 Sep 1997
  SWINDOW: Handled Win95 IDL bug for draw widget Y scroll bars.  RES
22 Sep 1997
  JD2YMD: Theo Brauers made loop index long to handle long arrays of JD.  RES
16 Jul 1997

    no greater than proposed size.  RES
11 Jul 1997
  VER: Added new keyword /OUT to plot pointers outside axes.  RES
  HOR: Added new keyword /OUT to plot pointers outside axes.  RES
10 Jul 1997
  DT_TM_FULL: New function to take a partial date/time string and
    expand it to a full date time string.  Useful to allow users to
    enter only times if they wish but still allow full date/times
    to be entered.  RES
8 Jul 1997
  BEST_FFT: Minor fix to avoid changing input value.  RES
1 Jul 1997
  CREATED: New routine to return a standard host, user, time stamp string.
    Ex: Created on tesla by Sterner on Tue Jul  1 14:22:15 1997

    added to file headers for reference.  RES
30 Jun 1997
  PRWINDOW: Added FACTOR=fct keyword.  RES
  PSIMG: Added new keyword, FACTOR=fct, to allow image size to be adjusted. RES
4 Jun 1997
  ROUND2: A version of round that works for big double precision numbers.
    For example, print,round2(9000000001.49999d0),form='(f20.5)' gives
    9000000001.00000, but round gives an error message and a wild value. RES
20 May 1997
  EVENT_LOG: Added new keyword ,/ADD, to add additional lines to last
    time tag in file.  This allows any number of lines under a given
    time tag.  Added /SCREEN to display text to screen too.
    Also slightly upgraded the help text.  This routine is
    really useful for logging events during processing.  For example
    errors and significant steps can be documented easily this way.  RES
15 May 1997
  PMATCH: Added new keyword, /ALL, to return indices of matches found.  RES
30 Apr 1997
  PMATCH: New routine to find a specified sequence of values in an array
    of numbers.  Does a pattern match using the where function.  RES
28 Apr 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Very minor fix to help text.  RES
21 Apr 1997
  MAKEMS: New routine that makes an array from a starting point to
    an ending point using a maximum step size.  It steps by this size
    until within the step size and then steps the rest of the way to
    the end point.  This is useful for moving from one point to another
    but without going over a certain step size.  RES
14 Apr 1997
  POLY_FIT2: Added new keyword XFIT=xfit to allow fitted Y to be
    returned for all Xs even though only some are used to compute
    the fit.  RES
3 Apr 1997
  SELECT_INTERVALS: New routine.  From a list of short time intervals
    can select the ones that fall within a given lower and upper cutoff
    value.  Keywords to control if any or some of interval may extend
    outside range.  RES
18 Mar 1997
  RADII: Added new keyword THICKNESS=thk.  RES
17 Mar 1997
  PSTERM: Just capitalized user name.  RES
14 Mar 1997
  XVIEW: Changed 24-bit TIFF display to use color_quanj instead of
    color_quan.  color_quanj uses the JPEG image coloring algorithm
    and gives a greatly improved result over the previous method for
    some cases.  This is most noticeable where small areas are important
    but do not have enough pixels to make themselves known to the previous
    algorithm.  RES
  STATE_NAME: New function to return list of 2 letter abbreviations
    for U.S. states, or full state name given abbreviation.  Has several
    variants of the returned name.  RES
7 Mar 1997
  DIST_SCALE2: New routine, 2nd version of a distance scale.  RES
5 Mar 1997
  IMGUNDER: For PS was using pixels of size 1 point (1/72 inch).
    These looked too blocky so they were reduced to 1/2 point.  RES
27 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added vivid color print option.  RES
  XOPTION: Added a second submenu to allow unrelated options.  RES
24 Feb 1997
  ARCS: Added new keyword THICKNESS.  RES
21 Feb 1997
  SET_ISOXY:  Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
  PLOTWIN: Added new keyword charsize=csz.  RES
18 Feb 1997
  NAXES: Added new keyword /NO25 to disallow steps that are multiples
    of 2.5.  IDL does not appear to use such steps so this option
    better matches the selected IDL tick mark spacing.  RES
17 Feb 1997
  XVIEW: Added sharpening to Tools menu.  BW only.  RES
  TVSHARP: New routine to do a simple sharpening on currently displayed
    image.  BW only for now.  RES
  CONCOORD: Generalized to more than 4 points.  RES
13 Feb 1997
  SETCOLOR: New routine to allow a single color table entry to be
    set.  Input color specification may be in decimal or hex
    (web format).  RES
12 Feb 1997
  ARCS: Made default be clip to plot window.  Added new keyword
    /NOCLIP to override this.  RES
6 Feb 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Bug fixed by Matthew Savoie, Systems Technology Associates.
    Bug showed up for the following call:
	print, dt_tm_mak(2451545L, -9.16488e+07) which gave
	1997 Feb  5 **:00:00 Wed.  Should now work.  RES
5 Feb 1997
  JSPLOT: Fixed to allow /SUN suncolors to work on color PS printer.  RES
4 Feb 1997
  SCREENTIFF: New routine to display a given TIFF image in a screen window. RES
3 Feb 1997
  DT_TM_MAK: Added two new format items: now can output month as a number
    and also day of the year.  Do help,dt_tm_mak(/help) for details.
    This gives dt_tm_fromjs the same new format items.  RES
  YMD2DN: updated to work with arrays.  RES
28 Jan 1997
  LINI: Added new keyword MAG=mag to allow mag value to be set.
    Also set default mag to 4 instead of 10.  Made active endpoint
    marker be unfilled by default.  RES
23 Jan 1997
  TNAXES: Removed the stop statement for tick spacings < 1 sec and
    changed the error message to a warning.  So now plots will still
    run.  RES
22 Jan 1997
  SUBIMG: Added exit code.  RES
17 Jan 1997
  D2DMS: New function to convert degrees to deg, min, sec text string.
    Intended for use with crossi as the x and y formatting function
    for working with lat/long.  RES
13 Jan 1997
  DT_TM_FROMCR: Added new keyword, /JS, to return date/time as JS.  RES
31 Dec 1996
  IZOOM: Corrected to handle small arrays.  The problem was this:
    Let a 4x4 array have x coordinates [0,1,2,3].  Izoom used to
    label the x axis 0 to 3 while displaying 4 pixels across.  This
    is not correct, it should label it 0 to 4.  This should now
    be fixed.  RES
  IMGUNDER: Corrected to handle small arrays.  Added new keywords
    XFRAC=xfr, YFRAC=yfr to give fraction into image to zoom.  RES
26 Dec 1996
  EVENT_LOG: Fixed a problem with the /DIFF command.  Also add new keyword
    /LOG to add time diff to log file.  RES
  GETKEY: Old routine that was dropped.  Had to bring it back since
    it's used in my librarian program.  RES
