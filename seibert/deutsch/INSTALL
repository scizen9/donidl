Distribution configurations:

1) Everything except the APO software.  This is most useful for astronomy-
related work.  This requires a reasonably up-to-date Astronomy User's
Library.
 GET: deutsch.tar.Z

2) Everything including the APO software.  This requires a reasonably
up-to-date Astronomy User's Library.  Only get this installation if you
want to use the APO (Apache Point Observatory) IDL software routines I've
written.
 GET: deutsch_apo.tar.Z

3) Just the miscellaneous routines which may of interest to the general
IDL user.  I try to include all other routines from other existing libraries
that get called from my programs.
 GET: deutsch_misc.tar.Z


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions on unix machines:

If you have the deutsch.tar.Z (or deutsch_apo.tar.Z or deutsch_misc.tar.Z)
file, copy it to the base of your IDL libraries structure (or wherever
you like) and extract it:

%  zcat deutsch.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

or the equivalent.  This will create a 'deutsch' directory and fill it
and other subdirectories as described in the manual installation
below.

If you already have the Astronomy Users's Library installed locally,
remove the astron subdirectory.  If you already have the UIT Library
installed locally, remove the uit subdirectory.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions on non-unix machines:

Create a "deutsch" directory and the desired subdirectories as follows:

   deutsch  ------  apo		only needed if you want APO related stuff
            |
            ------  astron	only needed if you don't already have AstronLib
            |
            ------  img		main IMG library
            |
            ------  imgroam	IMGroam program and support software
            |
            ------  misc	miscellaneous software
            |
            ------  docs	various documentation (such as it is)
            |
            ------  uit		only needed if you don't already have UIT Lib


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additional Setup:

1) Add the deutsch libraries to your IDL_PATH perhaps with something like:
setenv IDL_PATH +$IDL_DIR/deutsch:$IDL_PATH


2) Add the deutsch*.help help files to wherever you have your other .help
files (I actually like to put in symbolic links, but whatever).


3) Currently no changes are suggested for the idl_startup.pro file


4) The following is optional.  It is not yet well implemented.  It
struck me as a great idea, but I never ran with it.  The idea is to
have a cluster (system) and personal file with program defaults in it..
i.e. any program can have hard-coded defaults, but could also call
GetDefVal() to find out default values which the user and administror
can easily set.. this could include default printers, tape drives, and
anything else.

define the following logicals:
     setenv IDL_SYSDEF $IDL_DIR/deutsch/docs/clusterinfo.dfh
     setenv IDL_PRSDEF $HOME/personalinfo.dfh
or in VMS something like:
     $ define/nolog IDL_SYSDEF "idl_dir:[deutsch.docs]clusterinfo.dfh"
     $ define/nolog IDL_SYSDEF "disk$user0:[username.idl]personalinfo.dfh"

These logicals define two files which contain defaults for certain
programs.  Any program, accordingly written, will first search the
personal file and then the cluster file or is neither are found use a
default.  Currently, these files are only used for specifying printer
queues, tape drives, and so on.

You can edit the "printers.lst" file to contain a list of all the
printers that are available on the cluster.  This is only useful if you
plan to use the SETPS and PSCLOSE procedures in the misc library.
