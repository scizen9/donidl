The DEUTSCH IMG library contains a collection of procedures useful for
astronomical work under the IDL Programming Language.  There are
several "general purpose" routines that others not working in astronomy
may also find useful.  However, many of these procedures call other
procedures in the Astronomy User's Library (from Wayne Landsman @GSFC).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution configurations:

1) Everything except the APO software.  This is most useful for astronomy-
related work.  This requires a reasonably up-to-date Astronomy User's
Library.
 GET: deutsch.tar.Z

2) Everything including the APO software.  This requires a reasonably
up-to-date Astronomy User's Library.  Only get this installation if you
want to use the APO (Apache Point Observatory) IDL software routines I've
written.
 GET: deutsch_apo.tar.Z

3) Just the miscellaneous routines which may of interest to the general
IDL user.  I try to include all other routines from other existing libraries
that get called from my programs.
 GET: deutsch_misc.tar.Z


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A brief discussion of what you will find in this library can be found
in the notes/imglib.doc file.  Installation instructions can be found
in the INSTALL file.  The library should works mostly on both VMS and
Unix platforms, but since the library is currently being developed on a
Unix Solaris 2.6 system, small (fixable) problems may crop up on
other platforms; please report them.

If you find some of these procedures useful, I would be delighted to
hear from you via email. You may send questions, comments, and
suggestions to deutsch@astro.washington.edu.  If you make improvements
to existing code, please Email along the changes.  The current
organization of the library is somewhat half-done; not all of the
procedures have proper headers, but hopefully that will come someday
soon.  In the mean time some procedures here may be of use to others.
Note that changes are likely to be frequent.  If you would like to
receive notices of important changes, send me Email and I will add your
address to the distribution.

How to obtain the IMG library:

% ftp ftp.astro.washington.edu        (IP=128.95.99.14)
    login: anonymous
    password: <your email address>
> cd /pub/idl/deutsch
> get README

If you can uncompress and untar tar files, you may simply get the tar file:

> binary
> get deutsch.tar.Z
         or
> get deutsch_apo.tar.Z
         or
> get deutsch_misc.tar.Z

Or otherwise, create the directories described in the INSTALL file and then
obtain all the files in the subdirectories by hand:

> get INSTALL
   (see details contained within)
> cd img
> lcd [.img]
> mget *.*
> cd ../misc
> lcd [-.misc]
> mget *.*
 etc.

(assuming local VMS system.)



See the INSTALL file for information on how to install the library
