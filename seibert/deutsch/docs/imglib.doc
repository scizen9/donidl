  The DEUTSCH IMG library contains a collection of procedures useful for
astronomical work under the IDL Programming Language. There are several
"general purpose" routines that others not working in astronomy may also
find useful.  However, most procecedures call other procedures in the
Astronomy Library (from WBL @ GSFC).

  A brief discussion of what you will find in this library can be found in
this file.  Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL
test file.  The library ought to be equally operation on both VMS and
Unix platforms, but since the library is currently being developed on a
Unix SunOS OpenLook system, small (fixable) problems may crop up on other
platforms; please report them.

If you find some of these procedures useful, I would be delighted to hear
from you via Email. You may send questions, comments, and suggestions to
deutsch@janus.astro.washington.edu.  If you make improvements to existing
code, please Email along the changes.  The current organization of the library
is somewhat half-done, but I won't get around to organizing things for a while.
In the mean time some procedures here may be of use to other.  Note that
changes are likely to be frequent.  If you would like to receive notices
of important changes, send me Email and I will add your address to the
distribution.


  The following text describes the main procedures of interest in the library,
but is not the complete description.  Use the "?" facility with the supplied
deutsch.help file to read all the headers.

1) PostScript Formatting routines:  SETPS, PSCLOSE, PSOUT
   These 3 procedures provide good support for quickly sending plots and
   images to PostScript printers.  Works under both VMS and Unix (SunOS at
   least).  Output of a single landscape plot is as easy as:
     IDL> setps,/land & plot,indgen(100) & psclose,/auto
   Default landscape sizes are used.  Custom ones can be specified.
   Support of multiple printers and selecting from lists is built in, but
   requires a little setup.
   The PSOUT procedure determines best sizes and offsets for any size image.

2) Cosmic Ray Removal Software:  IMGCLEAN, CLEANEXAMINE
   This software is very useful for removing cosmic ray hits from images for
   which there is NO CR split possible.  The algorithm relies on identification
   alone and no comparison of 2 images.  Currently tweaked for HST PC images,
   and ought to work with most images with undersampled PSFs with a little
   experimenting with parameters.  CLEANEXAMINE is a facility for patching
   up the final cleaned image.  It allows you to remove cosmic rays that
   IMGCLEAN missed and repair the occaisional obliterated star.
   IMGclean is not the greatest, but is worth looking into if you have PC
   images that need cleaning or are searching for CR removal code.  Comments
   welcome.

3) Image Reading Software:  IMGREAD
   IMGREAD can read read virtually all GEIS (i.e. .hhh & .hhd) images
   including SDAS and STSDAS multigroup files.  If you need to read WF/PC
   images and all other sorts of GEIS images (except some NAXIS = 3 images)
   this is useful.  Reads WF/PC images easily.

4) Interactive Image Display: IMGROAM
   IMGROAM is a mouse (Widget) driven interactive image "roaming" software
   package.  A small window with the compressed image is displayed with a small
   square indicating where the 512x512 Frame Window is viewing.  Zoom and
   Stretch are easily adjusted.  X,Y,RA,DEC,DN Values are continuously updated
   as the cursor tracks across the image.  Easily handles images as large as
   2048x2048.  Includes centroiding and useful Astrometry creation support.
   Supports HST GSSS image Astronometry.  Very useful for creating an
   Astrometric solution for a CCD from a GSSS extraction.  Some primitive
   support for allowing users to add their own "key activated" functions
   (example for pressing C to remove Cosmic Ray at current cursor location
   included.)
   NOTE:  IMGroam prefers to have an astromical image header supplied, but
   is also useful for examining arrays like:
     IDL> a=indgen(512,512)
     IDL> imgroam,a
